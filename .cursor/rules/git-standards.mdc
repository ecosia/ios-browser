# Git Standards

## Commit and Push Requirements

- **CRITICAL**: Always await user confirmation before pushing or making commits
- Once confirmation is granted, follow the established rules
- Split file changes into separate, logical commits
- Commit messages: Auto-prefixed with ticket numbers (don't add manually)
- Ensure git committer and author always match date and time
- Maintain clean commit history - avoid numerous small commits that clutter the log
- Skip .gitignore changes by default unless specifically requested

## Branch Management

- Production code is on the main branch
- New features are implemented by branching off main
- Use descriptive branch names that reflect the feature or fix
- Keep branches focused on single features or bug fixes

## Code Review Process

- All changes require review before merging
- Address feedback promptly and thoroughly
- Ensure CI/CD checks pass before requesting review
- Test changes locally before pushing
