# Mobile Decision Records (MDR)

This directory contains Mobile Decision Records (MDR) for the Ecosia iOS Browser project.

## What is an MDR?

A Mobile Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural or technical decision made for the mobile application, along with its context and consequences. We use the [MADR (Markdown Any Decision Records)](https://adr.github.io/madr/) template format.

## Creating a new MDR

1. Copy the template from an existing MDR or use the MADR template
2. Name the file using the format: `NNNN-short-title.md` where `NNNN` is the next sequential number
3. Fill in all relevant sections
4. Submit a PR with the new MDR for review

## MDR Statuses

* **proposed** - The decision is being discussed
* **accepted** - The decision has been accepted and is in effect
* **deprecated** - The decision is no longer relevant
* **superseded** - The decision has been replaced by a newer decision
